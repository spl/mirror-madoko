## A Maker of Mirrors

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spl/mirror-maker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spl/mirror-maker)

This repository contains scripts to mirror other repositories to GitHub with the
idea of exposing the code to more people and serving as a backup if the sources
become unavailable. These scripts are run once a day by [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org).

**No projects are currently being mirrored.** See the `git` commit history for
examples of previous mirrors.
